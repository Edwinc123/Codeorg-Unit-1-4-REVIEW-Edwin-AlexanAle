  <b>Unit 1</b>
  <hr> 
  <p> Unit 1 focuses on the challenges that come from the need to represent digital information and how information like numbers,text,images, and sounds that are represented in bits also how compression works , and the social impacts of digitizing the world's information. Some new things that we learned were bits,binary,overflow error, and lossless compression. Bits are a single unit of information in a computer that is represented as 0 or 1. Binary is a way of representing information using 2 options.Overflow error happens when attempting to represent a number that is too big. Lossless compression is a process for reducing the number of bits to represent something without losing any information and itâ€™s reversible</p>

    <b>Unit 2</b>
    <hr> 
    <p>Unit 2 focuses on how the internet was designed to connect devices and people together and how the different protocols of the internet work and the impacts that the internet has had on modern society.</p>

    <b>Unit 3</b>
    <hr> 
    <p> In unit 3 was focused on debugging, pair programming, user interface, and event driven programs. Some new things that we learned was input, which is data that is sent to a computer for processing by a program. They can come in different forms like tactile interaction, audio,visuals, or text. Outputs which is data that is sent from a program to a device, they can come in different forms like inputs. And user interfaces that use inputs and outputs that allow a user to interact with a piece of software and can include a variety of forms like buttons,menus,images,text and graphics.</p>

  <div class="wave" id="u4">
    <b>Unit 4</b>
    <hr> 
    <p>In unit 4 we learned things like variables, conditi+onals, functions, and Boolean values. Variables are placeholder/containers that are used to store a single piece of data whether its numbers,numbers, etc and variables keep code organized and easier to read . Boolean values are a type of information so they can also be evaluated in boolean expressions using logical operators. Conditionals allow a program to make decisions based on certain logical operators to find out whether a specified condition comes out as true or false.Functions hold reusable code and help in organizing code and making it easier to read.</p>
