  <b> Lesson 1: Welcome to CSP</b>
    <h4>Check For Understanding</h4>
  <h4>Q:What are your own strategies and insights about how to learn best? And, how are they similar or different to the ones that you just heard about from other students?</h4>
  <h4>A: I learn the best when the thing they are teaching is shown and explained. I have the same problem that Jasmin mentioned and to help with that I started to take notes so I could stay focused as well.</h4>

  <b> Lesson 2: Representing information </b>
    <h4>Check For Understanding</h4>
    <h4> Q:Sending Complex Messages: Recall when you built your information sending device. Why did we decide to send a message as a sequence of two options rather than modifying our devices to represent more options?For example:Modifications with two options bend straw forward once bend straw backwards once bend straw forwards twice bend straw backwards twice vs.Four options bend straw forward bend straw backwards bend straw to the left bend straw to the right</h4>
  <h4>A: we decided to send a message as a sequence of two options  so we can process information in an easier way</h4>

  <b> Lesson 3: Circle Square Patterns</b>
    <h4>Check For Understanding</h4>
    <h4>Q: Counting in Binary: How would you explain a number system to someone who had never seen numbers before?</h4>
  <h4>A: a system that uses a combination of numbers  to express information.</h4>
  </div>
  <!-- Q&A -->
  <div class="wave" id="li">
  <b> Lesson 4: Binary Numbers</b>
    <h4>Check For Understanding</h4>
    <h4>Q: 1.Two schools are merging and to adapt to the increased size of the student body, the school is changing its system for keeping track of all student IDs from a system that uses 4-bit binary numbers to one that uses 8-bit binary numbers (AKA 1 byte). Which of the following best describes what effect this change will have? 2.Each time we add another bit, what happens to the amount of numbers we can make? 3.How many bits would be needed to count all of the students in class today? 4.What are the similarities and differences between the binary and decimal systems?</h4>
  <h4>A: 1.The 8-bit system will be able to represent sixteen times as many values as the 4-bit system. 2.Each time we add another bit, what happens to the amount of numbers we can make? 3.You would need 6 bits. 4.the Binary system there are only 1 and 0 and in the decimal system there are ten digits 0 to 9 .Both the binary and decimal system are used to represent numbers.</h4>
  </div>

  <div class="wave" id="li">
  <b> Lesson 5: OverFlow and Rounding</b>
    <h4>Check For Understanding</h4>
    <h4>Q: 1.Modern car odometers can record up to a million miles driven. What happens to the odometer reading when a car drives beyond its maximum reading? 2.When using bits to represent fractions of a number, can you create all possible fractions? Why or why not?</h4>
  <h4>A: 1.It goes back to 0. 2.You cant becuase some are too small.</h4>
  </div>
  <!-- Q&A -->
  <div class="wave" id="li">
  <b> Lesson 6: Representing text</b>
    <h4>Check For Understanding</h4>
    <h4>Q: Multiple Representations:
    "The binary pattern 01000001 represents the number 65." Write a brief response explaining whether you believe this statement is always true. Explain your reasoning.</h4>
  <h4>A: No because the 1 or 0 can be assigned different values so it wont always be equal to 65</h4>
  </div>

  <div class="wave" id="li">
  <b> Lesson 7: Black and White images</b>
    <h4>Check For Understanding</h4>
    <h4>Q: 1.Converting from Analog to Digital:Which of the following would result in a better digital approximation of an analog black and white image? 2.Pixel Data:Assume your friend just sent you 32 bits of pixel data (just the 0s and 1s for black and white pixels) that were encoded after sampling an image. Choose the two statements that are true.</h4>
  <h4>A: 1.Decreasing the size of each sample square, thus increasing the number of sample taken. 2. The correct width and height must be input into the pixelation widget to produce the image.The fact that only 32 bits were used to represnt the image indicates relatively large sample squares were used and the digital image may vary from the analog image significantly.</h4>
  </div>

  <div class="wave" id="li">
  <b> Lesson 8: Color images </b>
    <h4>Check For Understanding</h4>
    <h4>Q: 1. Analog vs. Digital: Which statement about analog and digial images is truer? 2.Describe how the process of sampling, RGB pixels, and binary sequences work together to display a digital color image.</h4>
  <h4>A: 1.Sampling an analog image more frequently produces a digital image with better represention 2.Sampling RBG pixels and binary sequences work together to display a digital color image by letting the computer know where the RBG pixel is going to be placed and what shade or color that pixel is</h4>

  <b> Lesson 9: Losseless Compression </b>
    <h4>Check For Understanding</h4>
    <h4>Q: 1.Lossless compression:What is the most important quality of lossless compression? 2.An author is preparing to send their book to a publisher as an email attachment. The file on their computer is 1000 bytes. When they attach the file to their email, it shows as 750 bytes. The author gets very upset because they are concerned that part of their book has been deleted by the email provider.If you could talk to this author, how would you explain what is happening to their book?</h4>
  <h4>A: 1.The data is transformed to usually make it smaller.It can always be reconstructed back to the original 2.I would tell him its because of lossless compression and that it reducing the number of bits needed to represent the book without losing any information. This process is reversible</h4>
  </div>
  <!-- Q&A -->
  <div class="wave" id="li">
  <b> Lesson 10: Lossy Compression</b>
    <h4>Check For Understanding</h4>
    <h4>Q: 1.You’ve been given a new cell phone with a 2 gigabyte data plan. You plan to use your phone for text messages, images, video, and music. Which of these categories are best compressed using lossless compression? Which of these categories are best compressed using lossy compression? Why?</h4>
  <h4>A: 1.Lossy compression should be applied to text messages and music while lossless compression should be applied to images and videos.compression can be applied to text messages and music because a reduction in the size and quality will only reduce few details about the text messages and music.lossless compression should be applied to the images and videos because the process is reversible</h4>

  <b> Lesson 11: Intellectual Property</b>
    <h4>Check For Understanding</h4>
    <h4>Q: 1.Creative Commons: How is a Creative Commons license different from a regular copyright 2.Imagine you were using some of our pixelation tools to create an image and you posted it online for your friends to see - but, a week later you find out someone took that image and put it on a T-shirt that they’re selling for $10 each.Now that we understand Copyright, what would need to change in order for the scenario from the warm-up to be okay?</h4>
  <h4>A: 1.It allows your work to be shared,reused, and remixed to help spark more creativity. 2.For the scenario to be okay the person selling the t-shirts would have to ask you for permission to use your image on the shirts</h4>

  <b> Lesson 12: Project-Digital information dilemmas</b>
    <h4>Check For Understanding</h4>
    <h4>Q: 1.Many museums have digital catalogs of their collections.What are the portential benefits and harms of creating these digital catalogs? 2.Why should we care about information being represented digitally? How does this impact you personally?</h4>
  <h4>A: 1.Provides information and  stores the catalogs in one place to keep it organized . One harm that can come out of this is the lack of security. 2.we should care because it provides for a faster way to do things. It impacts us personally because it could be your personal information that is being digitized </h4>
